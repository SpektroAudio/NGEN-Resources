# NGEN - Scripts

These are some of the scripts that we use internally that can be useful for more advanced NGEN users.

- **NGEN_DrumGenTemplate.py**: A GUI editor for creating templates for the DRUMGEN generator.
- **NGEN_Display.py**: Utility to mirror NGEN's display, take screenshots and record videos.

Please keep in mind that these are designed as internal / development tools so they do not feature a well-refined UI/UX like other Spektro Audio projects and they may not be feature-complete.

We don't offer support for these tools but they are safe to use.
