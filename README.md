## About NGEN

NGEN is a unique 16-track MIDI sequencer design in SÃ£o Paulo / Brazil that lets you combine multiple algorithmic/generative generators and MIDI FXs to sequence multiple hardware or software MIDI instruments.

It offers a completely new way of creating and performing music by abstracting the composition process. Instead of writing sequences from scratch, NGEN lets you quickly generate a new sequence for your drums, basslines, melodies, and chord progressions with a push of a button.
